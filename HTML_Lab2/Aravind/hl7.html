            <h2 class="article-subtitle">HL7</h2>
            <p class="article-body">HL7, otherwise known as “Health Level 7”, is an international standard to guide healthcare providers in transferring clinical and administrative data between software applications. This is to ensure data standards and methodologies within healthcare systems can consistently communicate accurate clinical information. Examples of this include patient records, laboratory records and billing information. </p>
            <p class="article-body">This is vital for patient’s needs to prevent them from filling out multiple forms for multiple tests required for diagnosis. Just imagine, trying to fill out the forms and you are sitting in immense amount of pain – Your cries of agony is beaten by the demand to fill out some forms. HL7 performs well by communicating between different device systems, to allow any documents, information or testing data to be received and sent, regarding a specific patient. To aid for a smoother process, integration engines are used to interpret incoming HL7 messages and transform it into a readable message for the respective system to read, with the reversed process for outgoing HL7 messages. </p>
            <p class="article-body">Through implementation of HL7, healthcare systems can adopt emerging data types and device specifications to communicate effectively between devices, without delay. Furthermore, it benefits by helping software vendors and healthcare providers to store and share data easily through digital matters, in hopes to reduce administrative burdens and improve patient care delivery. </p>
