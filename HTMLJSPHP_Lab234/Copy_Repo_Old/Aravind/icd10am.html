            <h2 class="article-subtitle">ICD-10-AM</h2>
            <p class="article-body">ICD-10-AM, otherwise known as “International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification”, is updated every three years to ensure correct and up-to-date classification on diseases and other health problems, associated with patient care. Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), ICD-10 sets the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions, with its usage by doctors, researchers, and patients’ medics. ICD-10-AM was developed to assist clinicians to ensure classification is current and appropriate for Australian clinical practices, specifically. </p>
            <p class="article-body">The tenth revision includes an alphanumeric classification containing codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, social factors and external causes of mortality or morbidity: all with its primary usage to classify causes of death. Each classification is structured by body system, site and intervention type. Within this document, this data is presented in a tabular list of diseases with its accompanying index. </p>
            <p class="article-body">By understanding potential causes of death within Australian’s community, we can re-orient the healthcare system by detecting and predicting variants of diseases, to ensure our health services are delivered readily. This is done by reviewing patient’s healthcare records to take note of observable abnormalities or any interventions that occurred during treatment. </p>
